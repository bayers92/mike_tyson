	<p class="lead-p">The photo blog is designed to allow you to show your personality. <u> Professionalism is absolutely critical. </u>  A good rule of thumb is to not post pictures that you wouldn't want the Dean of your Business School to see. Have fun and show personality, but if you think a picture is borderline appropriate - don't post it. </p>
